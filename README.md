This was created to demonstrate how tabbed activities currently recover from a tombstone.  The best way I have found to make it work is to enable developer options on your tablet.  In the developer options, turn on "Don't Keep Activities".  Run this app and click "Tab Test".  Close the tablet and reopen it.  You can put break points on the SaveStateToBundle and ReloadStateFromBundle methods to see what is happening.
